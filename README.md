# DataFrame ChatBot - Ollama

## Project Description

The **DataFrame ChatBot - Ollama** is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to interact with a pandas DataFrame using a chatbot interface powered by Ollama's language model. Users can upload CSV or Excel files, ask questions about the data, and receive natural language responses, including basic data analysis or even simple data visualizations.

The chatbot is integrated with a **Pandas DataFrame Agent**, enabling the bot to respond intelligently to user queries about the data. The app also allows users to generate plots (like bar charts) from the data based on their queries.

## Features

- **File Upload:** Users can upload CSV or Excel files.
- **Data Preview:** The app shows a preview of the first few rows of the uploaded data.
- **Chatbot Interface:** A chatbot that answers questions about the DataFrame.
- **Plot Generation:** Generates a simple bar plot based on the data if the user asks for a plot.
- **Easy to Use:** No prior coding knowledge required—just upload your file and start asking questions!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- pandas
- langchain
- langchain_experimental
- langchain_ollama
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wasim437/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name


   pip install -r requirements.txt

   How to Use
Upload a File:

Click on "Choose a file" to upload your CSV or Excel file.

The app will display a preview of the first few rows of your DataFrame.

Ask Questions:

Type your questions about the DataFrame in the input field (e.g., "What is the average value in column X?").

The assistant will provide an answer based on the data in your file.

Generate a Plot:

You can ask for a simple plot by including "plot" in your question (e.g., "Can you show me a plot of column X vs column Y?").

The app will generate a bar plot if there are enough columns in the DataFrame.


Example Use Cases
Question: "What is the average value in column X?"

Question: "Can you show me a plot of column A vs column B?"

Question: "What are the top 5 rows of the dataset?"


Limitations
Currently, the app supports only CSV and Excel file formats.

The plot generation functionality is basic; only bar plots are supported for now.
